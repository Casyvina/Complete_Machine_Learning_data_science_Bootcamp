# Heart Disease Prediction Kaggle dataset
![logo](heartdisease.jpg)

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset is from Kaggle and contains information about patients, including the following features:

- age
- sex
- chest pain type
- resting blood pressure
- serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- resting electrocardiographic results
- maximum heart rate achieved
- exercise induced angina
- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
- target (presence or absence of heart disease)

  
## To train a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease, we will follow these steps:

- Load the dataset: We will load the dataset into a Python programming language environment.
- Preprocess the data: We will preprocess the data to ensure that it is in a format that can be used by the machine learning model. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and scaling the data.
- Split the data into training and testing sets: We will split the data into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Select a machine learning algorithm: We will select a machine learning algorithm that is appropriate for the task of predicting the presence of heart disease. Some popular machine learning algorithms for classification tasks include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Train the machine learning model: We will train the machine learning model on the training set. This involves feeding the model the training data and allowing it to learn the relationship between the features and the presence of heart disease.
- Evaluate the performance of the model: We will evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set. This involves feeding the model the testing data and predicting the presence of heart disease for each patient. We will then compare the predicted values to the actual values to calculate the accuracy of the model.
- Deploy the model: Once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can deploy it to production. This may involve saving the model to a file or deploying it to a web service.

Once you have trained a machine learning model, you can deploy it to production to predict the sale price of new bulldozers.
